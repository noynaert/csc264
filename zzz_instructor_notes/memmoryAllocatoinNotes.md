# Notes on Memory allocation

[Laurie Wired video about memory allocation in C++, C, and ARM Assembler](https://youtu.be/HlUBE70h2C0?si=qsrqCe-mO3DoAWMq)

The above video is good for C++ and C.   It uses ARM Assembly.  That is good because it shows a different Assembly language,  Anyone who knows Intel/ARM should be able to understand what is going on.

I suggest first doing a Java program that something similar.  First, use the Int wrapper class to set up space for an integer and store it.  Do an explicit `Integer r0 = new Integer(42);

Maybe do another program that demonstrates how much we have abstracted in Java with things like ArrayLists.
