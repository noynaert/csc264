# 01.010 About this course

The course title is Assembly Language and Computer Architecture.

This course is where you learn how computers work.  We will be working "close to the metal."  Assembly language writes programs that are just above the level of electronics.

## You probably will not write a full program in Assembly Language

For most programmers, assembler is only important for understanding how the computer system is handling data.

Knowing Assembly Language and Architecture are important for many security issues.

Sometimes drivers for hardware must be written in assembler.

Debugging some difficult issues in a software system may involve reverse engineering or examining the assembly language.
