# 00.010 About this course

The course title is Assembly Language and Computer Architecture.  We will study both, but the real intent of the course is not to make you expert Assembly Language programmers.  The purpose is to give you understanding and tools to be a well-rounded IT professional.

This course is where you learn how computers work.  We will be working "close to the metal."  Assembly language writes programs that are just above the level of electronics.

## You probably will not write a full program in Assembly Language

For most programmers, assembler is only important for understanding how the computer system is handling data.

Knowing Assembly Language and Architecture are important for many security issues.

Sometimes drivers for hardware must be written in assembler.

Debugging some difficult issues in a software system may involve reverse engineering or examining the assembly language.

## Assembly Language feels foreign to people who do not know it.

Most computer languages were written to be understandable by humans.  Even non-programmers can figure out what a program does if it is written in a language like Java, Python, COBOL.  High level languages are designed to
reflect human thought patterns.  Languages like Java are designed to avoid common mistakes by programmers

Assembly language is different.  It is close to the machine (and close to machine language).  It is often incomprehensible, even to people who know how to program in a high level language.  Assembly language forces the programmer to to think like the computer.
