Machine Language is 0s and 1s.  In the earliest proto computers, 0 represented an switch set to off, and a 1 represented a switch set to on.  On modern computers 0s and 1s are represented by low voltage and high voltage.

Hexadecimal notation is just a shorthand way of reading and writing binary code.  it is easier for humans to deal with it and less prone to errors.
