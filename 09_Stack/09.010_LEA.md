09.010 LEA

LEA means "Load Effective Address"

It is basically a variation on the formula from last week:

$address = VALUE(BASEREG, IDXREG, MULTIPLIER)$
LEA takes the usual q, d, w, b suffixes

The syntax is 

```
lea OFFSET(BASEREG, IDXREG, MULTIPLIER), %REGISTER
```
- ***OFFSET*** may be either a label or a constant
- ***BASEREG** and ***IDXREG*** are registers
- Multiplier is 1, 2, 4, or 8

The `lea` instruction just loads the address into the register without accessing memory.
