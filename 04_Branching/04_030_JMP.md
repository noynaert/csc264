# 03.030 JMP

The `jmp` instruction changes the contents of the RIP register.

The `jmp` instruction takes one operand, the target we are jumping to.  It can take several forms.

## `jmp` to a label

```
    jmp _exit
```

## `jmp` to a number or an address

We will not be doing these right now, but we will later.

### Backward jumps

It is possible to jump backwards.  To make a "near" jump, the argument would be a byte as a 2's compliment representation of the number.
