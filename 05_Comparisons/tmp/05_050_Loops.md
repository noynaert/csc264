# 05.050 Loops

## Two types of loops

There are two types of loops in programming:  Pre-test loops and Post-test loops. Pretest loops check the condition before executing the loop body, while post-test loops execute the loop body first and then check the condition.

## High-level language loops vs assembly loops

High level languages have a variety of types of loops.  They include `for`, `for each` `while`, and `do-while`, and `repeat-until` loops.  These loops reflect how humans think about repeating tasks.  Loops take care of a lot of housekeeping details and simplify the logic.

***Assembly language does not have loops.***   Assembly language only has instructions that can change the flow of control.  By combining these instructions, we can create loops.  We, as programmers, have to take care of all the housekeeping details.


Last week, we did a post-test loop.  Here is the code.  The loop itself is after the `_top` label.  

```gas
.data
  base: .quad 2   # The number being raised
  exp:  .quad 4   # The power  (MUST BE 1 or Greater)
  result: .quad 0 # b^e   or base^exp

.text
_start:

_setup:
    ### initialize some values
    movq exp, %rcx

    ### load the accumulator with 1
    movq $1, %rax

    ### stash the base in r8 because we will multiply by the base
    movq base, %r8

_top:
    mulq %r8
    decq %rcx
    jnz  _top

_saveResult:
    movq %rax, result

```

## Post-test loops

The test is done at the bottom of the loop.  In the above example, the `jz` instruction is the test.
