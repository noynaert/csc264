# 03.060 Add

* Add, and its variations (addq, addl, addw, addb) perform integer addition.  
* Add takes two operands.  The source may be memory, a literal, or a register
* At least one of the operands must be a register
* The destination must be a register or a memory location
* The add instruction cannot do memory-to-memory adds.  It also cannot do literal to memory adds; at least one operand must be a register.
* The add instruction adds the source to the destination.  The result is saved in the destination, and the former value of the destination is destroyed.
