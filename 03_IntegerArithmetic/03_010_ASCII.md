# 03.010 ASCII

ASCII stands for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange."  The "American" becomes significant.

ASCII was developed to standardize transmissions between teletype machines.  They were also being used to communicate with computers.

Originally, it was 7 bits, with one possible parity bit. $2^7$ equals 128, so the codes were from 0 through 127. The IBM-PC expanded ASCII by adding 128 additional characters.

## Structure of the ASCII table

The first 32 characters are control characters for teletype machines.  Some of them are still used (you don't need to memorize them).

Decimal|Hex|Control<br>Character
:---:|:---:|:---:
6|6|ACK (acknowledge)
8|8|(BS backspace)
9|9|(tab)
10|A(LF line feed or)
12|C|(FF form feed)
13|D|(CR Carriage Return)
27|1B|(ESC escape)
