# 03.xxx MUL

NOTE:  This was not included in the 2025 version of the course.  It should be incorporated later

There are many forms of the multiplication command.  We are going to use the simplest (and perhaps the fastest) form of the multiplcation family of commands.

The command is `mul`. It comes from 8086.  The 8086 had a simple multiplication circuitry built into the `AX` register.  The 8086 was only 16 bits wide, so it was easy for multiplication to overflow.  The overflow was put into the DX register.

The MUL command has been preserved.  It has grown in width and always uses the full AX and DX registers to hold the output.

The MUL command only works with unsigned numbers.

There is only one operand.  The one operand must be a register, it cannot be a literal or a memory location.  The number in the specified register is multiplied by the value in the RAX register and the result is always RAX and RDX registers

The LSB are in RAX.  In most cases we don't have overflow on a 64 bit system.  It is possible to check for it, but for now we will not be concerned about overflow.

```asm
    movq $5, %rax  # put the multiplicand in rax
    movq $6, %r9   # put the multiplier in r9
    mul  %r9       # result is in AX and DX

    movq %rax, result  # move the LSB to memory
```
