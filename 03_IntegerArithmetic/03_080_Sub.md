# 03.080 Sub

Important points to review:

* Negative numbers are represented in 2's complement
* Subtraction is done with 2's complement
* The leftmost bit is the sign bit
* Signed numbers cut the range of positive numbers in half
* The sign bit tends to propogate to the left.

## Like addition, but subtracting.

```asm
.data
  num1: .quad 14
  num2: .quad  6
  sum:  .quad  0

.text
_start:
    # register-to-register add
    movq num1, %rax   #load the rax with the first number
    subq num2, %rax
    movq %rax, sum

_exit:
    #Exit the program, returning the sum
    movq $60, %rax
    movq sum,   %rdi
    syscall
```
