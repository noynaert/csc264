# 03.010 Suffixes

## Suffixes

Most arithmetic operations must specify how many bytes they are operating on.  Like the `mov` command, suffixes indicate the size

bytes|meaning|suffix
:---:|:---:|:---:
1|byte|b
2|word|w 
4|long|l
8|quad|q

As with mov, these operate on the LSB.

add may be used without suffixes in some cases.  We will use suffixes as the class style.
