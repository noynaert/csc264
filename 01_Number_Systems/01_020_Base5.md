# 01.020 Base 5 Number System

Base 5 is not going to be important to us this semester.  I am only covering it because it seems to be a base that people are comfortable working in.

## Algebra review

* $5^3 = 1 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 125$
* $5^2 = 1 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 25$
* $5^1 = 1 \cdot 5 = 5$
* $5^0 = 1 = 1$


## Base 5 has 5 digits

The digits are 0,1,2,3,4  ***There is no symbol for "five."*** There are also no symbols for six, seven, eight, or nine.  To represent the idea of five we write "$10_5$"

To represent six we write $11_5$ which means 1 group of 5 plus 1

## Positional Number Systems


$n$ | $5^n
---|---:
0 | 1
1 | 5
2 | 25
3 | 125

Let's look at $2134_5$


2 | 1 | 3 | 4
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
125|25|5|1
$5^3$ | $5^2$|$5^1$|$5^0$

```text
     2 ⋅ 125 = 250
     1 ⋅  25 =  25
     3 ⋅   5 =  15
     4 ⋅   1 =   4
             +____
               294
```

## Conclusion:

$2134_5 = 294_{10}$

$2134_5$ and $294_{10}$ represent the same number.  They are just different notational systems.
