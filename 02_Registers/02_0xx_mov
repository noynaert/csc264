# 02.0x0 `mov`

The `mov` command is the most used command.

## Source Destination

The `mov` command **_copies_** from the source operand to the destination. The source remains unchanged (It does not move)

`mov` can move data between registers.

`mov` can move data between a register and memory

The source and destination **_cannot_** both be memory locations.

`mov` cannot move 64 bit values directly to memory.

## Sizes

Sometimes the `mov` command can figure out how many bytes should be moved.  In those cases, you may use simple `mov`

However, sometimes the number of bytes is harder to determine.  There are specific versions of `mov` that specify the size:

* `movb`: Move byte (1 byte).
* `movw`: Move word (2 bytes).
* `movl`: Move doubleword (4 bytes).
* `movq`: Move quadword (8 bytes). 

It can be good style to use the sized versions, even when just `mov` would work.  In this class, we will use this convention.
