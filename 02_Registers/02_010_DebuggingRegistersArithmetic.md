# 01.010 Debugging, Registers, and Arithmetic

This week we will be covering Appendix C and chapter 4 of the textbook. 

Debugging itself is a useful and necessary skill.  We will also use it to examine what is going on with registers and arithmetic.

We will be using the gdb debugger.  It is part of the gnu C/C++ compiler package.  The gdb program is designed for C, so it may look odd at times.

I will also be using the kgdb program, which is a KDE graphical frontend for kdbg.
