\begin{questions}

\section*{\unit\_010 -- About Stacks}
\begin{samepage}
    \question What is a stack?
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\par
\begin{samepage}
    \question What are the two main operations that may be performed on a stack?
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\begin{samepage}
    \question What does LIFO mean?  (I forgot to use the term in the video, but it is in the notes.  Look it up in the notes or do a web search.)  Explain in paragraph form what LIFO means.
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\par
 \begin{samepage}
     \question Stacks have a top.  Doe they have a bottom?  Explain your answer.
     \vspace{5mm}
 \end{samepage}
 \par
  \begin{samepage}
      \question Can stacks logically grow downward?
      \vspace{5mm}
  \end{samepage}
  \par
   \begin{samepage}
       \question What is "RPN arithmetic?"  Why does almost every discussion of stacks include at least a mention of RPN logic?
       \vspace{5mm}
   \end{samepage}
   \par
    


\section*{\unit\_020 -- Functions and the Stack}
\par{\fontfamily{qzc}\selectfont\textbf{Video Length }}
\begin{samepage}
    \question How are function calls in high level languages similar to function calls in assembly language from the perspective of the operating system? 
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\par
\begin{samepage}
    \question How are function calls in high level languages different than function calls in assembly language from the perspective of the programmer?
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\par
\begin{samepage}
    \question What is the stack frame? (Give a general description, not just list of the information included in the stack frame.) 
    \vspace{10mm}
\end{samepage}
\par
\begin{samepage}
    \question What information is stored in the stack frame?
    \vspace{16mm}
\end{samepage}

\begin{samepage}
    \question In the video, I recorded the value of the rsp in each function.  What is the rsp register, and why was I focused on just that register?
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\par
\begin{samepage}
    \question In the video, I was writing the values of the rsp in the text editor.  To what extent was I simulating the stack when I did this?
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\par
\begin{samepage}
    \question In the video, I mentioned that the stack grows down in memory.  Did using the editor reflect the "downward" growth of the stack?  ?
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\question In the video, did each new value of the rsp get larger or smaller than its previous value?
    \vspace{5mm}
 \begin{samepage}
     \question In homework 9, I cautioned you to make sure that you always pushed an even number of quads onto the stack.  Based on what you know now, why did I give this advice?
     \vspace{5mm}
 \end{samepage}

\section*{\unit\_030 -- Stack Frames}
\par{\fontfamily{qzc}\selectfont\textbf{Video Length }}
\begin{samepage}
    \question What is the relationship between a function and the stack frame?
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\begin{samepage}
    What is the first item pushed onto the stack when a function is called?
\par
\end{samepage}
\begin{samepage}
    \question What is the "Red Zone" of the stack frame?
    \vspace{5mm}
\end{samepage}
\par
 \begin{samepage}
     \question What is the RBP register?  How is it related to the stack and functions?
     \vspace{15mm}
 \end{samepage}
 \par
 \begin{samepage}
     \question What does ABI stand for?  Explain why it is important to the assembly language programmer.
     \vspace{5mm}
 \end{samepage}
 \par
 \begin{samepage}
     \question What does the ABI say about the alignment of the RSP when the function is called.
     \vspace{5mm}
 \end{samepage}
 \par
 \begin{samepage}
     \question When I ran kdbg, what digit did all the RPB values end with.  Why was this significant?  Would I have gotten the same result if I had had been displaying the address in decimal (explain)?
     \vspace{5mm}
 \end{samepage}
